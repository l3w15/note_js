## Nowt bu' green
### Testing framework built in vanilla JavaScript
#### Built in TDD style without the use of any libraries or testing frameworks
#### By [Lewis Watson](https://github.com/l3w15) and [Carlos Trapet](https://github.com/CarlosTrapet)

Whilst building a note app in vanilla JavaScript we got sidetracked and found it more interesting to build the beginnings of a testing framework. We were particularly interested in being able to test equality in arrays in JS. Lewis is a northerner at heart and came up with the name - you should always be aiming for nowt bu' green when testing!

To view our example tests:
```
git clone git@github.com:l3w15/note_js.git
open SpecRunner.html
```
